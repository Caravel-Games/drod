<h3><u>Game Elements</u></h3>
<p><a name="tendry" /><img src="images/tendry.jpg" />
<b>Tendry</b> is you. For information about movement, see <a
 href="keyboard.html">Keyboard Commands</a>.</p>

<p><a name="monsters" /><img src="images/monsters.jpg" />
<b>Monsters</b> block your way and must often be defeated to continue on.
To engage a monster in combat, strike it with your sword.  You may also bump
into an enemy directly to fight it, but then it will get in the first hit.
Fight outcomes are not random, but are instead based on the ATK and DEF stats
of you and your enemy.
Right-click an enemy to view its stats on the side-bar and see how many HP
you would lose in order to defeat from your current position.
Beware of enemies that can strike you from a distance or when you step next to them.
You will want to refer to the authoritative <a href="monster.html">Monster
Reference</a> for more information.</p>

<p><a name="health" /><img src="images/health.jpg" />
Find <b>health</b> to raise your HP.
Small potions give 15 HP, medium ones give 50 HP, and large ones give 200 HP.
Your HP has no limit, but don't squander it fighting tough monsters.  If you
waste too much, you may find your way blocked by monsters you can not defeat,
and you will have to restore back to an earlier save point and try again.</p>

<p><a name="powerups" /><img src="images/powerups.jpg" />
<b>Power-ups</b> will permanently raise your ATK or DEF by one point.
The damage you inflict each hit in combat is the difference between your ATK and the
enemy's DEF, and vice-versa.  This means that acquiring an ATK point causes
your hits do one more point of damage, while a DEF point will cause enemy
hits to inflict one less point of damage.</p>

<p><a name="equipment" /><img src="images/equipment.jpg" />
Search for equipment, such as <b>swords and shields</b>, to
fight more difficult monsters.  Swords typically increase your ATK and shields
increase your DEF.  Certain equipment gives you unique abilities.
There are also rare accessory items that give you special powers.</p>

<p><a name="walls" /><img src="images/walls.jpg" />
Like <b>walls</b> in the real world, these are obstacles that prevent movement.</p>

<p><a name="crumbly" /><img src="images/crwalls.jpg" />
<b>Crumbly walls</b> are ready to fall apart when bashed
by a weapon, but they have to be looked for as they blend in with solid walls.</p>

<p><a name="pits" /><a name="water" /><img src="images/pits.jpg" />
<b>Pits</b> and <b>water</b> are not particularly dangerous
since Tendry is too smart to accidentally fall into them, but be careful
of monsters that fly or swim.</p>

<p><a name="yellowdoors" /><a name="greendoors" /><a name="bluedoors" />
<img src="images/ydoors.jpg" />
<img src="images/gdoors.jpg" />
<img src="images/bdoors.jpg" />
<a name="keys" /><img src="images/keys.jpg" />
<b>Doors</b> are opened with <b>keys</b> of the same color.  Each key will open one door.
You will encounter tricky puzzles involving opening these doors.</p>

<p>You may also close doors by standing on them and locking
them with the <a name="lock"><b>Lock</b></a> command (using up a key).
You may walk along the top of closed doors while standing on them.</p>

<p><a name="skeletonkey" /><img src="images/skeletonkey.jpg" />
A <b>skeleton key</b> can open any one yellow,
green or blue door.</p>

<p><a name="orbs" /><img src="images/orb.jpg" />
Striking <b>orbs</b> with
your sword will cause them to shoot bolts of energy out to open, close,
or toggle one or more doors in the room.  Right-click orbs to see what doors
they affect.</p>

<p><img src="images/plates.jpg" />
Like orbs, <a name="pressureplates"><b>pressure plates</b></a> affect
doors when activated.  Some orbs and pressure plates open doors
that you can't unlock with a key.  Pressure plates are activated each time
they're depressed (weighed down by something) and also when they are released
by removing the weight on top of them.
Right-click plates to see what doors they affect.</p>

<p><a name="trapdoorgates" /><a name="reddoors" /><a name="trapdoors" />
<img src="images/rdoors.jpg" />
<b>Trapdoor gates</b> (or <b>red doors</b>) are opened when all of the
<b>trapdoors</b> in a room have collapsed.
Trapdoors fall away to pit or water after being stepped upon once.</p>

<p><a name="tarstuffgates" /><a name="blackdoors" /><img src="images/bkdoors.jpg" />
<b>Tarstuff gates</b> (or <b>black doors</b>)
are opened when all of the <a name="tarstuff"><b>tarstuff</b></a> 
in a room has been removed.</p>

<p><a name="moneydoor" /><img src="images/moneydoor.jpg" />
<b>Greckle gates</b> may only be operated by paying
the appropriate coinage (10 greckles).
Make sure to always have enough money on hand by defeating monsters.
You may also close greckle gates by standing on them and using the <b>Lock</b> command
(spending money).</p>

<p><a name="opengates" /><img src="images/sistergates.jpg" />
<b>Open gates</b> can be closed by orb, pressure plates, or using the <b>Lock</b>
command (expending a key or money).
Be careful not to close gates you will need to pass through later.</p>

<p><a name="multiplier" /><img src="images/multiplier.jpg" />
The <b>item multiplier</b> shows the effect items will have relative to their
base value in the current area (x1 = normal).  For example, an attack power-up normally
gives one point of ATK.  When the multiplier is 5, then you would instead receive
five points of ATK when picking one up.  The multiplier influences health potions,
ATK and DEF power-ups, and the cost of toggling greckle gates in the current area.</p>

<p><a name="map" /><img src="images/map.jpg" />
The <b>minimap</b> shows the rooms you have explored in the current area
and marks your current location (boxed in the center).
If a room has any power-up items remaining, it will
be shaded golden. If only monsters remain, it will be shaded red.
If only closed doors remain in the room, it will be shaded blue.
Cleared rooms are white.</p>

<p><a name="levelmap" /><img src="images/levelmap.jpg" />
Acquiring a <b>level map</b> will mark rooms on your minimap
that you have not yet explored in the current area.
There are some secret rooms not marked on maps.  Try to find them!</p>

<p><a name="exitstairs" /><img src="images/stairs.jpg" />
<b>Stairways</b> connect areas of dungeons together.
Most levels are completed by finding stairs leading to the next level.</p>

<p><a name="platform" /><img src="images/platform.jpg" />
Floating <b>platforms</b> can be used to cross areas of pit or water.
</p>

<p><a name="bridge" /><img src="images/bridge.jpg" />
<b>Bridges</b> must be anchored to a wall, floor, trapdoor, or similar object
to remain in place. If all its anchor points are removed, the bridge falls down into the depths, taking
everything it supported with it.</p>

<p><a name="hottile" /><img src="images/hottile.jpg" />
<b>Hot tiles</b> are dangerous to stand on.
You will lose 5% of your HP each time you touch one.</p>

<p><a name="oremites" /><img src="images/oremites.jpg" />
<b>Oremites</b> are small creatures that feed on metal.
They are not dangerous by themselves, but you are forced to put metal items, like your sword,
away when walking around in an area covered with them.
</p>

<p><a name="briar" /><img src="images/briars.jpg" />
Dead <b>briars</b> block your way, but are not otherwise dangerous. However,
a patch of briars connected to a <a name="briarroot"><b>briar root</b></a> will grow outwards
each time a threat is sensed.
Standing next to a briar patch when fighting a monster is a very bad idea.</p>

<p><a name="scrolls" /><img src="images/scroll.jpg" />
<b>Scrolls</b> contain information that may or may not be useful.
&nbsp;Step on the same square they are in to read them.</p>

<p><a name="forcearrows" /><img src="images/forcearrow.jpg" />
<b>Force arrows</b> prevent movement in the opposite direction they
point. &nbsp;The north-pointing force arrow could be stepped onto from
all directions except northwest, north, and northeast. &nbsp;Once
you step onto a north-pointing force arrow you can leave in all
directions except southwest, south, and southeast.</p>

<p><a name="bomb" /><img src="images/bombfuse.jpg" />
<b>Bombs</b> can be detonated with a 
burning <a name="fuse"><b>fuse</b></a> or striking them with a sword.
When a bomb explodes, anything within a range of 3 squares of the bomb will
be damaged.
If another bomb is located within that range, it will explode as well in a chain reaction.
A fuse can be activated by walking away from a fuse endpoint, or by an explosion.
They will not burn against the direction of force arrows.</p>

<p><a name="tunnels" /><img src="images/tunnel.jpg" />
<b>Tunnels</b> allow you to quickly move
from one area of the room to another.  When Tendry is standing on a tunnel
square and moves in the direction the tunnel faces, he will reappear on the
closest tunnel square in the same column/row of that direction.</p>

<p><a name="mirrors" /><img src="images/mirror.jpg" />
<b>Mirrors</b> reflect the aumtlich's gaze,
and can also be used to weigh down pressure plates.
Tendry can push them around by himself, or he can use his sword to do so.
He can destroy them by striking them head-on with a sword.</p>

<p><a name="arrowrotator" /><img src="images/arrowrotators.jpg" />
When Tendry steps on an <b>arrow rotator token</b>,
all force arrows in the room are turned 45 degrees in the direction indicated.
The token then changes direction, and stepping on it again will rotate arrows back.</p>

<p><a name="tarstuffswitcher" /><img src="images/tarswitcher.jpg" />
When Tendry steps on a <b>tar/mud switcher</b>,
all tar in the room changes to mud, and vice-versa. Other versions also exist.</p>

<p><a name="visiontoken" /><img src="images/visiontoken.jpg" />
Stepping on a <b>vision token</b> gives Tendry
enhanced awareness of his surroundings for the current room.
This allows him to see what is hidden under tarstuff.
Stepping on the token again removes this effect.</p>

<p><a name="disarmtoken" /><img src="images/disarmtoken.jpg" />
When Tendry steps on a <b>disarm token</b>, his sword is taken
away. The upside of this is that while he's swordless, he can walk on trapdoors without
dropping them. He can get his sword back by stepping on the token again or leaving the room.</p>

<p><a name="orthosquares" /><img src="images/ortho.jpg" />
<b>Orthogonal squares</b> prevent all movements of diagonal 
directions. &nbsp;This means that if Tendry is standing on such a square, he can only 
leave this square by north, east, south or west. &nbsp;It also means that he cannot 
enter an orthogonal square diagonally.</p>
