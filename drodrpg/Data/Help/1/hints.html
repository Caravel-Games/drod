<h3><u>Tendry's Tips and Tactics</u></h3>
<p>Stalwart soldiers are trained from their youth in the art of combat.
Heed my words to become an expert, and courageous, swordsman.
</p><p>
---
</p><p>
Gauge carefully the strength of a monster:<br />
If your ATK is weaker than its DEF, you won't be able to harm it.<br />
If your DEF is as strong as its ATK, you may fight with impunity.
</p><p>
Take advantage of your sword.  Strike monsters with it to gain the <b>first hit</b>.
Bump into monsters with your body, and they score the first hit.
</p><p>
Though valor is a virtue, there is wisdom in avoiding monsters that don't need
to be fought.  A life point saved is a life point earned.
</p><p>
Never use <b>your last key</b> unless you're sure you can get more.
</p><p>
You will need to raise your ATK power to defeat monsters with high DEF.
</p><p>
Fools forget that they can move in <b>eight directions</b>.
</p><p>
<b>Force arrows</b> block even the strongest power from crossing them.
</p><p>
It is sometimes possible to avoid wasting your keys to open doors.
Look for clever opportunities.
</p><p>
<b>Right-click orbs and pressure plates</b> to know what doors they affect.
&nbsp;They are entirely predictable and simple to understand.
</p><p>
The <b>roach queen</b> spawns tough eggs to protect itself when threatened.
Eggs can make an effective barrier, but cannot harm you.
</p><p>
<b>Evil eyes</b> will strike if you cross their path, but are surprised from behind.
Try to get the drop on them.
</p><p>
<b>Goblins</b> are cunning, yet cowardly.
&nbsp;They won't strike unless I turn my back to them.
</p><p>
<b>Tarstuff</b> is only vulnerable to attack at certain points along its edge.
Study each variety to become a master tar cleaner.
</p><p>
<b>Tar mothers</b> make an entire tar blob dangerous to engage.
Defeat her before clearing the rest of the tar.
</p><p>
Beware monsters that can strike from a distance.
They must be dealt with quite carefully.
</p><p>
<b>Giant wyrms</b> are some of the toughest foes.
You will need to be quite strong to defeat them.
</p><p>
<b>Brains</b> of themselves are weak, but they make the attack
power of monsters around them doubly strong.
</p><p>
Don't ever go up against a <b>slayer</b> unless you have made the utmost preparations.
</p><p>
Look for blocked-up hidden passages to <b>secret areas</b>.
