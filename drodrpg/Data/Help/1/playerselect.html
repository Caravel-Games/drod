<h3><u>Player Selection Screen</u></h3>
Choose "<b>C</b>hange Player" on the <a href="commands.html">Main Menu</a> to access
the Player Selection Screen. This screen has the following options available:
<br />
<p><a name="select"><b><u>O</u>kay</b></a> - selects the highlighted player profile. Each player profile
contains user preference settings and its own game progress.</p>
<p><a name="new"><b><u>N</u>ew Player</b></a> - creates a new player profile. This option is useful
when you have more than one person playing DROD on this installation.</p>
<p><a name="delete"><b>Delete player</b></a> - permanently deletes the selected player profile. This
includes deleting the player's saved games,
so make sure this is really what you want to do!</p>
<p><a name="export"><b><u>E</u>xport</b></a> - saves the active player profile to disk
with all its saved games. This option facilitates transferring your player
settings and game information to a different game installation.</p>
<p><a name="import"><b><u>I</u>mport</b></a> - loads a player profile exported to disk.
This allows you to recover exported player saved games.
Hint: to import saved games for a specific hold (set of levels),
you must first import the hold into your installation, and then import the player data.</p>
<p><b><u>C</u>ancel</b> - returns to the previous screen.</p>
