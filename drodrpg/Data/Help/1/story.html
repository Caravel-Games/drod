<h3><u>The Story</u></h3>
<p>
<b>Tendry</b> was not having a good day. He'd marched several miles underneath the
surface of the <b>Eighth</b> with his army to
staunch the expanding threat of the Underground Empire.
There, despite the words of <b>Beethro Budkin</b>,
a professional smitemaster from Dugandy who had come to warn them,
his batallion went into battle against a superior force and was routed.
</p><p>
For most soldiers, this meant certain defeat.
But Tendry was no ordinary soldier.
He was a member of the <b>Stalwart Army</b> from the grand city of <b>Tueno</b>, and
that meant only one thing.
He could take a butt-kicking with the best of them and sing about it afterwards.
</p><p>
Meeting up again later with the notorious Beethro only served to increase Tendry's
resolve to not give up.  Beethro thought Stalwarts
inexperienced in delving into the Beneath.  But what a Stalwart lacked in experience, he could make up in heart.
He would show them.  He would show Beethro and the Imperials that Stalwarts are
not to be taken lightly without a second look.
And maybe...just maybe...Tendry would even live to tell the tale.
But in the meantime, Tendry will tell his tale to you.
</p><p>
Join Tendry the Stalwart as he sets out on his adventure, and help him live to tell
the tale of his grand exploits in the Great Beneath.
