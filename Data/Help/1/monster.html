<p><a name="roaches"><h3>Roaches</h3></a></p>
<p>
The five-foot dungeon roach is a common sight in infestations all over the world.
It can survive all sorts of adverse conditions - extreme heat and cold,
low oxygen, even weak acid. It doesn't like bright light, although it will
survive in bright light if it has to.  Although it can stand extreme heat,
its carapace is not equipped to withstand explosions,
and it can't survive in those areas of the Beneath that are hot enough to
burn even the air. Thankfully.
Dungeon roaches feed on whatever they are able to scavenge, their large,
sophisticated digestive system doing most of the work. They will tend to
aggressively attack any threat, if without tactics any better than
"head straight for it and bite," which on the whole probably shouldn't be
called "tactics." On the Eighth, they are traditionally used as a source of meat,
which, when the internal organs are removed and the meat cooked thoroughly,
surprisingly turns out pretty good. Smitemasters often have a clause in
their contracts which states they retain ownership of any roaches they slay for
this reason - it makes a good supplement to the seasonal smitemastering trade.</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="queens"><h3>Roach Queens</h3></a></p>
<p>Roach queens give birth to roaches, fulfilling much the same role as queen bees.
Unlike bees, however, all roaches that are born are considered workers - the
roach queen usually carries around most, if not all, of the ingredients required
to make roach eggs and is usually fed by her worker children during quiet,
safe moments (and occasionally feeds <i>on</i> her worker children, usually
when she is low on a few key roach-baby ingredients). Roach queens can be
identified amongst their children by their enlarged abdomen, their glossy,
silver wings (although they never fly), and, most tellingly, the fact that
all the roaches are usually attacking any threat and the roach queen isn't.
</p><p>
When threatened, the roach queen will attempt to scurry as far away from the
threat as possible, occasionally stopping to lay eggs in promising-looking areas.
As these are roaches, this is almost anywhere.  The larvae will hatch into
mostly-developed roaches in a matter of seconds. Roach queens lay eggs at a
much faster rate when they are running away from a threat in this manner,
relying on their children for defense.  This rate is predictable, and the alert
smitemaster can count precisely how long it will be until the roach queen lays
more eggs. Some roach queens are used in the roachmeat industries, but it turns
out to be far more cost effective to hire smitemasters to clean out infestations
and haul the carcasses back up than to breed roaches in captivity (which is
costly, as the problems when a roach gets loose are much greater than with
other, more docile meats.)</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="rock"><h3>Rock Golems</h3></a></p>
<p>Rock golems were an early creation of the Empire, back in the days when they
were just figuring out the basics of mineral-based life. Unfortunately, the
Empire found them rather difficult to control - not because they are rebellious
or willful, which they are not. But they are really, really dumb, and they just
don't understand instructions very well. They don't remember them very well,
either, unless they're really simple. If you tell the rock golem to go to the
field, pick up some nice round rocks, and carry them to your house, you may
discover later that the rock golem got confused, pulled your house up from its
foundations, and carried it to the field. As a result, the empire tends to only
use them as brute force defenders when possible.
</p><p>
While golems do have a brain, it only gets used when they are faced with
something that their raw instinct can't deal with, such as dealing with
obstacles in their path. While they can speak, their vocabulary is rather
limited and shallow. They don't need to eat, and instead take great pleasure
in crushing their prey with their large and heavy fists. They won't kill
anything else that is a rock, and since their intelligence level is low, this
means that someone clever could easily disguise themself as something
rock-shaped and escape their clutches.
</p><p>
Rock golems are very difficult to kill permanently, as if you break them down,
they will eventually reconstruct themselves over time. It takes much longer for
them to be prepared for combat again, however. But for the practical purposes
of smitemasters, the worst thing about golems is probably the piles of rocks
that are left when you "kill" them. These will become an obstacle, so you will
have to be careful where you choose to attack the golem. It is possible to
destroy a golem completely (whether or not it is already broken down) by using
a bomb, however.
</p><p>
Rock golems move in a direct fashion. If the direction toward their target is blocked, they will not move. They are not smart enough to move around obstacles by themselves, and will need to be "guided" around them.</p>
<hr />

<p><a name="giants"><h3>Rock Giants</h3></a></p>
<p>Back in the days when the Empire was just beginning to figure out mineral based life, 
several thousand experiments were carried out. Of course, not all of these were successful, 
but they did lead to the creation of rock golems. This lead to thousands and thousands 
more experiments trying to solve the problem of golem intelligence.
</p><p>
But what happened to the rejects? Uncounted rock creatures were stored underground, 
tightly packed together. Combine this with the rock golem's ability to very slowly 
rebuild itself over time, and it was perhaps inevitable that the remains of these creatures 
did not always remain... entirely separate when reconstructing. And once bound together, 
the rock giants were not eager to fall apart again.
</p><p>
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and these titanic creatures display far 
greater intelligence than their golem components (though four times a golem brain is still dumb). 
They understand simple commands and can carry them out reasonably well, so rather than being used 
as brute force defenders, rock giants are used as heavy lifters, miners and construction engineers.
</p><p>
Though unable to fit through the smaller passages, they are formidable in combat. Even a direct 
sword strike is not enough to kill one, as the giant will break apart into its component golems 
who will then continue the attack. Aside from the use of heavy explosives or collapsing/heating 
the floor on which they walk, it is very difficult to do more than break a rock giant apart into 
a few very angry golems.
</p>
<hr />

<p><a name="wraithwings"><h3>Wraithwings</h3></a></p>
<p>Wraithwings are one of the few dungeon creatures that fly.
Even then, they can't do it very well. They usually have to stick to near the
ground, where the air currents won't buffet them around so much.
Wraithwings resemble small winged demons, and anyone who's really studied
flight can tell you that it's a wonder wraithwings can fly at all.  They're
heavier than most birds, with not a great amount of strength in the forelimbs.
It takes constant, steady flapping to keep them afloat, but they occupy a niche
that few other creatures do.  Up on the surface, they usually stick to the
expansive and deserted lowlands that few other creatures inhabit because
of the minor problem of the extensive flooding every summer.  During that
time, they migrate into the dungeons because they have strong, adept legs
and can cross the deep chasms that defeat every other creature
who makes the attempt.  Wraithwings are smart, and will usually only attack
an intruder to their territory when they can surround them.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="eyes"><h3>Evil Eyes</h3></a></p>
<p>Evil eyes, like wubbas, don't have any discernible method of digestion.
Unlike wubbas, however, evil eyes are far less subtle in their feeding habits.
Evil eyes get their name from their appearance - they appear to be a giant
eyeball, covered in a translucent slime that they generate and use to
lubricate the floor if they have to move. Normally, evil eyes can be found
in groups of ten to twenty, although more and less have been sighted often
enough to confirm this is merely a tendency. Their teamwork in watching
certain areas, and the observed gathering of evil eyes, suggests some sort of
communal instinct, and possibly communication, although nothing as yet is
evident from their behavior. They will watch for likely prey to cross their
field of vision and stir into life, charging at it blindly until they reach
it.  They quickly cover their prey in slime to stun and prepare it, then
slowly digest it. Thankfully, they're quite docile until they notice their
prey, which can make a thoughtful smitemaster's job easier.
</p><p>
Evil eyes are sometimes used to make eyeball pudding, in nearly all cases
inadvisably and against the wishes of any and all who have to eat it.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="serpents"><h3>Serpents</h3></a></p>
<p>Serpents are huge, red reptiles that live deep in the dungeons Beneath.
They are subtle creatures, attuned to the secret vibrations of the soil.
They're normally much larger than any other
creature around, some having been sighted that are hundreds of feet in
length. Thousands, if using actual feet. They usually feed on
smaller animals, using their long bodies to restrict their prey's movement
until closing in for the kill.  As they're so large, they do have trouble
changing direction and can't make sharp turns. Even more concerning is that
their mighty body muscles, which propel them along the ground, aren't
capable of subtle correction. One of the things serpents have given up to
grow to such a size, in fact, is any ability to fine-tune their movement.
Their movements are chaotic and hard to predict, but not entirely random.
</p><p>
Don't let this sad regression fool you, however, into thinking that serpents
are easily dealt with, oh no. Their muscles are strong enough to resist even
the greatest of pressures. Their skin is hard as rock.  Smitemasters will
occasionally - if they relish the prospect of carrying a heavy roll of skin
up a mile or so of stairs - roll up serpent skin and sell it aboveground,
where it's used as a kind of leather. It isn't that flexible or easy to
work with, but it's incredibly durable and very strong. The only problem is
getting some, as it's heavy...and on serpents. A very
skilled smitemaster will have cracked the code of how the heartbeats of
the soil affect how serpents stalk their prey and how serpents react when
they know danger hasn't passed but can't quite see it.
Serpents change preference for vertical and horizontal movement every five turns.
They continue moving forward when their prey is directly in front of or directly behind them.
Diagonal movement by an exterminator was, at one point, critical in successfully
removing serpents from a dungeon, but orthogonal squares have recently taken away this advantage.
When dealing with orthogonal squares, it is best to stay as many steps away from a serpent's
head as possible while trying to lead it into a dead end.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="rattle"><h3>Rattleserpents</h3></a></p>
<p>Blue serpents, also called "rattleserpents" or derogatorily as "rattlesnakes," are almost 
identical to their red counterparts, but rattleserpents are weak at their tails 
instead of their heads. In order to destroy a rattleserpent, an exterminator must 
hit the serpent's tail with their sword in order to shorten in. This means that a 
thirty foot (six tile long) long snake will require an exterminator to hit the 
serpent's tail a total of five times in order to kill it. If a rattleserpent gets 
trapped in a dead end, then it remains stationary.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="adder"><h3>Adders</h3></a></p>
<p>The <a href="empire.html">Empire</a> created the green adders after serpents and rattleserpents,
when it was observed that both rattleserpents and serpents 
could essentially be rendered useless by being lured into dead ends.
Luring an adder into a completely sealed dead end will result 
in the delver not being able to dispose of the adder, as the head is unreachable.
</p><p>
Unlike other serpents, adders have enlarged heads which allow them to consume other monsters,
with the exception of rock giants, gentryii, and other serpents.
They grow one tile for each monster eaten. Adders will also eat the pile of boulders that is left when 
a rock golem or giant is killed.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, this dramatic increase in size made the head a vulnerable area.
An adder will shrink by one tile each time its head is stabbed. 
Adders will shrink like serpents if trapped by their own bodies or the body of another adder.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="brains"><h3>Brains</h3></a></p>
<p>The most disturbing of all the monsters in the Beneath looks altogether
too much like a giant, pink brain.  Monsters that resemble body parts are
very, very creepy. What's even creepier is that the brain doesn't attack.
At least, not directly. No, it knows all the ins and outs of the surrounding
terrain like the back of its...brain...and will hijack the
thought patterns of other creatures, giving them gentle suggestions on how to
defend themselves when danger approaches. So when that mindless roach moves
out of the trap you laid for it, navigates through a maze and heads straight
for you amongst a herd of other creatures, going around your defenses one by
one, you will know who is responsible.
To adapt to brains, you must learn how they think.  And when you do, you
will learn that sometimes intellect is no match for raw instinct.
Not in chess, maybe, but in other places.
They do, for better or for worse, have a mouth, so presumably they eat.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="wubba"><h3>Wubbas</h3></a></p>
<p>Wubbas are strange, strange creatures.
The eating habits of the wubba have never been observed,
though it has been theorized that they eat lichen and the occasional squashed
corpse by ingesting it through their porous skin. The outer portion of
a wubba's body is soft and fluffy, rather like a marshmallow, but they have a
harder core where presumably the internal organs are.  That is, if the skin
does not itself take care of some of the functions we normally associate with,
say, the stomach or the spleen. If they spot a meal, the wubbas will
rush to it, although they are often blocked by obstacles in their path. 
They follow their prey around until they can get it in such a position where they can
smush it. Or so it's thought by those who support the Porous Theory. It's
possible they are just really, really bored and follow new things around like
puppies in fits of excitement, as evidenced by the
excited little noises they make when a smitemaster tries to pierce their thick,
bouncy skin. We may never know for sure. In any event, wubbas move just like rock golems.
</p><p>
Wubbas get their name from a common
childhood toy that looks just like them - a big white blob. These are
everywhere because they can be specially molded, put together with love, and
sold for hundreds to a family with more money than sense.  Or a poor parent can
just grab a pillowcase, stuff it with something cuddly, sew it up into a
vaguely oval shape and present it to a thankful child.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="tar"><h3>The Living Tar</h3></a></p>
<p>The Living Tar is one of the most intimidating sights seen in the
Beneath. It's not hard to see why. Not because it has a very thick outer skin,
held together by a very strong form of surface tension (indeed, unless it's
stabbed on a flat part where you can get a sword in far enough, it won't even
break). Not because it can grow up and over walls, covering them completely in
blue goop (the only way to uncover them being to plough into it). Not because
it forms rubbery, stable globules of tar that block up vital passageways that
won't be broken by the strongest thrust. Not even because it can split into
completely separate, sentient, savage entities called tar babies when there
isn't enough surface tension left to hold solid chunks of tar together.  It's
because everything the tar does, even when it only looks like
a slightly transparent glob that just visibly pulses like an infernal blood
vein, seems to be infused with malice.
</p><p>
What's worse - sometimes a <a name="tarmother">tar mother</a>, which only ever appears as a
pair of bulging eyes glaring out of their lair, will reside deep within the
tar. She isn't content until the entire cavern is covered with tar and her
babies.  Occasionally she will close her eyes, concentrate, and will the tar
to grow outwards. She can even coax tar that's been separated from the main
body to grow until it rejoins the rest of the tar.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="mud"><h3>The Awakened Mud</h3></a></p>
<p>Just like the Living Tar, the Awakened Mud is a sticky creation of the <a href="empire.html">Rooted Empire</a>. 
Some years ago, 583rd Tar Technician, in sudden inspiration, created it. 
As soon as that happened, he became the 1st Mud Coordinator, and managed to sway several 
of his friends to become Mud Coordinators as well. This substance caused the tar monopoly 
to be broken, as architects now have a choice of substances. The mud team is also a 
younger and more dynamic group of people, and they have helped make the reddish substance 
much more popular than anyone could have expected.
</p><p>
Mud is similar to tar in many ways, but opposite in the most important of them. 
Rather than being vulnerable at the sides, mud can only be cut at its corners, and is protected 
on its edges. If you are on the outside of mud, this means that it is impossible to have 
a slab of mud that is uncuttable. If you are on the inside, you must be extremely cautious, as 
it can be very easy to end up in a box of mud with no way out.
</p><p>
A mud mother performs the same task as a tar mother. Every thirty turns, the Mud Mother will 
cause all of the mud in a room to expand by one square. If mud is unable to continue a form of 
at least two squares wide and two squares long, mud babies will be formed. Mud babies, like tar babies,
follow the same movement patterns as roaches.
</p><p>
Stable mud itself, for the most part, is a breeze. As long as you are on the outside of it, there 
is practically no way to have an uncuttable piece of mud. In order to be able to escape from a mass 
of Mud, a delver must make sure that he has at least one side of free space or wall that he is able 
to escape to. As soon as a delver is encased in mud, it will be impossible to escape.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="gel"><h3>The Forbidden Gel</h3></a></p>
<p>Long ago, the <a href="empire.html">Rooted Empire</a> engineered living gel,
a substance similar to the Living Tar.
However, the Empire's powerful Tar Authority feared competition from the new gel
and successfully lobbied for its use to be forbidden.
More recently, perhaps due to the widespread acceptance of the Awakened Mud and the subsequent
weakening of the Tar Authority, the Forbidden Gel has begun to be used once again.
</p><p>
Gel is a green substance is much stickier and more viscous than its tar and mud counterparts, 
and because of that, it can only be cut on its inside corners.
Gel differs from tar and mud in a number of other key ways as well.
Gel babies, being extra sticky, move like wubbas and rock golems, unlike tar and mud babies,
which move identically to roaches.
Gel babies can also cross shallow water, whereas tar and mud babies cannot.
Due to gel's increased surface tension, a gel mother's influence is reduced.
Gel mothers can only expand masses of gel to which they are physically connected,
unlike tar and mud mothers, which can expand all tar or mud in a room.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="spiders"><h3>Spiders</h3></a></p>
<p>If anything could be said to be the evidence of a malevolent mind at work
in the dungeons, it would be spiders. Spiders appeared twenty or so years ago,
almost out of nowhere (figuratively and in actuality).  They just so happened
to not be the traditional dark colors of the smaller, aboveground spiders,
but instead a strange shade of blue that exactly matched the color of a
popular style of floor tiling. This rendered spiders almost invisible on
that flooring.  Smitemasters learned to stare real hard to catch glimpses
of the spiders when their red, beady eyes were visible. But no more.
</p><p>
There were many complaints by smitemasters, excavators, and building crews.
Dungeon owners themselves were sick of hearing complaints when prospective
smitemasters learned they had used the infamous Palace style in their
dungeon.  Needless to say, they were also and a little concerned that they
themselves might be killed without warning while touring their dungeon.
In time, the Architect's Association officially recalled the style. That
would have been the end for the spiders.  They're none too bright and on
every other type of floor they could have been spotted a mile off, if it
hadn't been observed that spiders have, somehow, recently learned to change
their skin color at will.  This, it is believed, is no mere mutation.
</p><p>
For a long time, spiders were thought to move identically to roaches,
but it has recently been discovered that they differ in one respect.
Unlike roaches, spiders can tread on shallow water.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="goblins"><h3>Goblins</h3></a></p>
<p>Goblins are one of the few denizens of the Beneath that are smart enough
to match wits with intruders from above. They're cunning, wily, and even
speak a vague approximation of the aboveground language. Their society is a
rudimentary, tribal culture that exists in pockets of the Beneath,
usually at the lower, safer levels of dungeons. Goblins, having occasional
contact with humans, have assimilated the more materialistic values of the
abovegrounders.  Sometimes they dabble in making small wooden ornaments with
varying degrees of skill. This, however, grates at the soul, and often
they'll just give up and mug passers-by instead. Those rare goblins who are
integrated into human society, having learned not to attack people and get
taken out into the streets and killed, usually take menial jobs.  Thankfully,
they enjoy the simplicity and directness of the work as opposed to the
politicking and bickering that accompanies more cerebral endeavors humans
undertake, and for the most part they are treated kindly.
</p><p>
Isolated groups of goblins usually work quite differently.  While very
simple and sometimes brutal, their society is surprisingly advanced, with
complex belief systems.  These are usually eroded by their first contact with humans.
When they attack, they tend to go for the back, believing that honor takes
a second place to staying alive.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="aumtlich"><h3>Aumtlich</h3></a></p>
<p>Rumors of unknown monsters are common in any society that sets great store on daring 
deeds done. Most can simply be dismissed as "The roach that got away;" but the most 
experienced smitemasters know that there is a grain of truth in every rumor. Some 
of these ancient rumors describe a species that exists in the deepest dungeons - 
one with a burning hatred of all people, a burning hunger for slaughter, and a burning 
gaze that instills a petrifying fear into everything it sees. It is believed that 
these gaunt beasts have been extinct for many generations, if they ever existed at all. 
Other people claim that they still live, lurking under the beds of naughty children 
who refuse to finish their leaf juice.
<p></p>
Recently, the journal of the noted dungeon-fauna-documentary producer Jaato Scrikely 
was discovered, which gives some weight to this rumor. Though badly burned, the last 
few pages were barely legible. The last recorded entry ends with: "The citizens called 
this area 'The Aumtlich Training Grounds.' There are thin beasts that are working on 
focusing their gaze into a steady, fiery gaze. I mustn't let them see me; some of what 
they looked upon was starting to smolder! Though I wonder, what is the proper plural 
form? Aumtlich? Aumtliches? Aumtlichen - gah, that sounds like some kind of plant. 
Wait, did I say that out loud? They're turning towards me, and aren't looking happy. I should get..."
<p></p>
The rest of the entry is badly burned and beyond recognition. Many smitemasters hope 
this journal is a fake made in poor taste, as no such creatures have been seen. Almost 
all smitemasters, though, have taken to checking under their beds each evening - just 
to be safe.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="skippers"><h3>Waterskippers and their nests</h3></a></p>
<p>Waterskippers are carnivorous animals, occuring naturally throughout the Eighth. 
Recently, the <a href="empire.html">Rooted Empire</a> has engineered Waterskippers to live underground, 
and has employed them to defend their tunnels. When Onsuary floods strike dungeons, 
the Empire uses the underground lakes to insert waterskippers.
</p><p>
After reaching maturity, two waterskippers will make a nest on the water, scavenging 
branches from nearby areas and solidifying them into rough piles with their saliva. 
After the nest is finished and a brief mating dance is performed, the female occupies 
the nest and begins to spawn offspring at a prodigious rate, three times faster than 
the roach queen, itself no slouch in this department. The offspring immediately begin 
to look for food, seeking any nearby prey. Waterskippers do not leave the water as a 
rule but will leap onto land to attack. The waterskippers' unwary prey can easily 
become overwhelmed by the sheer number of attacking beasts.
</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="seep"><h3>The Seep</h3></a></p>
<p>To call these creatures "simple vapors living inside the walls" makes them seem less 
deadly then they actually are. Although the <a href="empire.html">Empire</a> has just recently been successful 
in developing a prototype and is only testing them in select dungeons, they have 
already created panic and fright inside of the Guild's halls. Prior to their existence, 
a Smitemaster could always feel a bit safer when his back was at the wall.
Now smitemasters must always be watchful for the presence of seep or risk falling prey to them.
</p><p>
Seep are able to travel on both walls and doors. If a door is opened while seep are on 
it, then they will die. They can also be removed by a strike with a standard issue sword. 
Although the creature's contents are complicated, their actual movement is very simple. 
In fact, they move almost exactly the same as a standard dungeon roach, meaning they 
will always come directly towards you. The difference between the two is that while a 
roach will prefer to move vertically if given a choice, a seep will choose which ever one 
will bring it closer to its target. The only problem is getting them to reach the edge of a wall 
or a door so, like roaches and most other dungeon creatures, you will have to be careful 
where you lead seep to.
</p><p>
In case you were wondering, "seep" is used for both the singular and plural.
</p>
<hr />

<p><a name="gentryii"><h3>Gentryii</h3></a></p>
<p>The harpactognathus gentryii is a creation of the early Empire which would be better left forgotten.
It is virtually indestructible, completely invulnerable to all known weapons and totally unfazed by explosions.
Even a fall from a great height would not kill a gentryii, though fortunately,
they are not capable of climbing out of pits.
As there is no known way to destroy gentryii, they must be subdued by some other means,
either locked up or chained to walls.
However, over time, as walls weaken, the gentryii are sometimes able to break free of their moorings and attack.
A chained gentryii is no threat to anyone who remains beyond the reach of its chain.
</p><p>
Although their trailing chains may resemble tails, gentryii have little in common with serpents.
They are capable of moving diagonally through the tightest of spaces and will pursue delvers relentlessly.
Fortunately, gentryii are no more intelligent than a common dungeon roach and can be blocked by the
simplest of obstacles, including their own chains.</p>
<hr />

<p><a name="fluff"><h3>Fluff</h3></a></p>
<p>Fluff is a sentient noxious gas, deadly to any living creature that comes in contact with it.
Clouds of fluff are essentially inert, but impassible, however, a single square wide cloud of fluff,
also known as a puff, is capable of movement.
Fortunately, puffs move very slowly, at a rate of one square every five turns,
making them easy to avoid in open spaces.
Puffs become dangerous when they appear in great numbers or when encountered in tight spaces.
</p><p>
Puffs will always target the closest living thing and attempt to move directly toward it,
however, it cannot navigate around obstacles in its path.
When a puff makes contact with its target, both the target and the puff are destroyed.
A puff destroyed over water will form a thin layer of ice on the surface.
When puffs gather in formations of two by two or more, they will coalesce into a larger cloud of fluff.
</p><p>
Fluff is commonly introduced to dungeons through vents placed in the floor.
An exposed fluff vent will release a single puff every thirty turns, however,
a vent covered by a cloud of fluff will cause the cloud to grow by one square in every direction every thirty turns.

Fluff is not affected by swords, which simply pass through it, however,
other weapon types may prove more effective.</p>

<p>Constructs are intelligent machines created by the Empire.
Despite some similarities, it would be a mistake to think of constructs as mechanical rock golems.
Like golems, constructs leave behind impassible remains when killed, however,
while rock golems can reportedly reassemble themselves after some unspecified length of time,
constructs are able to do so quickly and with remarkable regularity.
As soon as the construct's internal chronometer reaches 30,
it will revive and continue its pursuit of any invaders.
Only when a room is clear and all constructs disabled will they stand down permanently.
</p><p>
Despite their remarkable capacity for self-repair, constructs are not invulnerable.
They can be destroyed permanently by explosions or being pushed or dropped into pits or deep water.
While constructs can walk through shallow water safely, if one is disabled while on shallow water,
it will not be able to restore itself.
As they are made up primarily of metal, constructs cannot withstand exposure to oremites,
and will never willingly walk on them.</p>
