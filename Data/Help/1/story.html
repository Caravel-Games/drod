<h3><u>The Story</u></h3>
<p>
Beethro Budkin is a fifth-generation Smitemaster - an expert swordsman employed
to clear out dungeons infested with deadly monsters.
One of his largest jobs was clearing out all twenty-five floors of <b>King Dugan's Dungeon</b>
in Dugandy, gaining great notoriety in the Smitemasters Guild.
After opening the Roasted Roach Grill, a bustling restaurant where Beethro sold off all
of the monster meat he collected while beneath, Beethro returned underground with his
curious nephew, Halph,
to investigate rumors of an underground civilization expanding the King's dungeon and
centered in a place called
<b>Rooted Hold</b>. Once arriving in <b>The City Beneath</b>, Beethro found the
Rooted Empire and unearthed many unsettling secrets. Many of the Empire's plans center
around an imminent "Grand Event" that has to do with destroying all people
living on the surface.
</p><p>
Now, join Beethro on an epic journey across the continents of the Eighth in this
concluding chapter of his quest for truth about the clandestine
Rooted Empire and its sinister plots deep beneath the surface.
Help Beethro unravel the mystery of the looming Grand Event in time to save his homeland!
</p><p>
Beethro lives in a world called The Eighth, currently named so because it was found to
have the shape of one-eighth of a pie.
